## Problem Statement (what problem to solve)
To build a table management system for a family-owned restaurant. The system would manage reservation, occupancy on its own. It would basically replace the job of the employee standing behind the reception desk. Making the operating processes of the restaurnat become more efficient, the system could manage tables to fulfill the maximum amount of customer needs, thus increasing profit and decreasing workload of waiters.

## Problem Setting (reasonable assumptions)
Assume there are 50 seats and 3 different sizes of tables in the restaurant. First of all, for the small sized tables, they are mainly for people coming in pairs, like couples. Secondly, the medium sized tables are for people coming in small groups, a maximum of 4 people, like small families. Lastly, as for the large sized tables. They are for people coming in large groups, supporting more than 4 people, likes a big group of family and friends.

As the customer base of the restaruant changes seasonally, so the number and the size of tables could be modified in different seasons by combining and separating different tables. However, the number of seats is fixed, due to the limited physical size of the restaurant. 

## Functionalities and Features
There are a variety of functions and features that this system could perform.

To begin with, the system is mainly used to manage the table status of the restaurant, including the occupying and releasing of tables. The system should display clearly which tables are occupied and which are not. It would be able to change the status availability of tables through the input system.

Apart from doing basic table management, it would also be able to perform simple processing or calculations. For example, the system could automatically assign tables for customers in different sizes. The table is not assigned ramdomly, but to suggest a vacant table which has minimal enough seats to fulfill the customer size.
